## 🔴 IMMEDIATE

### Pipeline hardening (2026-07-06) — done, one manual step left
- [x] Scorer fail-closed: location gate + enforcePolicy() + Sonnet 5 eval ✅ deployed to CT 203
- [x] Auto-apply rewired: triage ≥4.5 → apply-orchestrator (gate+eval both clean) ✅ live for tomorrow's 07:00 cron
- [x] Data layer repaired: tracker restored on CT 203, reports renumbered 015-024, sync-ct203.sh ✅
- [x] Finder expanded: Workday (Tempus/CrowdStrike/DaVita), OpenAI/Twilio/SentinelOne/HiddenLayer/Gong/Dialpad/LivePerson boards, BIC scraper fixed ✅
- [ ] **PATRICK:** install the BIC cron step: `ssh root@10.1.30.50 "cp /opt/career-ops/career-scan.new /usr/local/bin/career-scan && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/career-scan"`
- [ ] Fresh base CV PDF for unattended applies (current fallback = Stripe-tailored from 05-25); name it to sort last in output/, e.g. `cv-patrick-moore-zz-base-<date>.pdf`

### Follow-ups overdue (31 business days, no responses)
- [ ] Stripe / WorkOS / Abridge ×2 — followup-check now works again (tracker was missing on CT 203); Telegram reminder fires with tomorrow's cron. Decide: follow up or let die.

### Backlog shortlist (verified live 2026-07-06, deprioritized by Patrick — apply via "apply #N" or ask Claude)
- Hightouch EM Agents 4.6 (remote NA, $220-400K) · Cloudflare DistSys 4.1 (Denver office!) · Vercel Security Cloud 4.3 (remote US) · Snowflake FDE 4.3 (remote US) · Komodo FDE 4.5→4.0 re-eval (remote US) · Databricks FDE 4.1 (20% customer travel — gray)

## 🟡 PIPELINE IMPROVEMENTS — Make the automation smarter

### Follow-up automation ~~(wire existing followup-cadence.mjs into Telegram)~~
- [x] Create `followup-check.mjs` — monitors Applied rows >5 biz days, Telegram reminders ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] Telegram notification with "follow up #N" / "wait #N" instructions ✅
- [x] Draft follow-up email templates in `templates/follow-up-emails.md` ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] Wire into `telegram-listener.mjs` — "follow up #N", "wait #N", status commands ✅
- [x] Track follow-up history in `data/follow-ups.md` ✅
- [x] Daily cron: scan → notify → followup-check chain ✅

### Interview prep auto-generation
- [x] `generate-interview-prep.mjs` — auto-generates prep docs from eval reports ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] Trigger: `--check` mode detects Interview/Responded without existing prep ✅
- [x] Trigger: Telegram "interview #N" auto-fires prep generation ✅
- [x] telegram-listener.mjs now updates tracker status AND triggers prep ✅
- [x] Daily pipeline chain includes `--check` step ✅
- [x] npm scripts: `npm run prep`, `npm run prep:check`, `npm run followup` ✅
- [ ] Story bank population (currently empty — needs first interview cycle)
- [ ] LinkedIn scrape for hiring manager (blocked on LinkedIn auth)
- [ ] Company culture signals (Glassdoor, tech blog) — inferred from JD for now

### LinkedIn Easy Apply automation
- [ ] Extend `apply-auto.mjs` with LinkedIn Easy Apply platform detection (`linkedin.com/jobs/view/`)
- [ ] Map LinkedIn form fields (resume upload, phone, address, work auth, cover letter toggle)
- [ ] Use existing `auth/linkedin-state.json` cookies
- [ ] Test on a throwaway application first
- [ ] Add `linkedin` to `auto_apply_platforms` in profile.yml

### Recruiter outreach engine
- [ ] After applying, auto-find hiring manager/recruiter on LinkedIn (from job posting or company page)
- [ ] Draft connection request note (1-2 sentences, Patrick's voice): "Applied to [Role] — [one proof point]."
- [ ] Telegram: "Found recruiter [Name] at [Company]. Reply 'connect' to send request."
- [ ] Wire into `telegram-listener.mjs` — add "connect #N" command
- [ ] Rate limit: max 5 connection requests/day to avoid LinkedIn jail

### Response tracking (email → status updates)
- [ ] Set up forwarding rule: recruiter replies → specific label/folder
- [ ] Parse inbound for signals: "schedule", "interview", "unfortunately", "move forward"
- [ ] Auto-update tracker status: reply detected → "Responded", interview invite → "Interview", rejection → "Rejected"
- [ ] Telegram notification on every status change
- [ ] Fallback: manual "responded #N" / "interview #N" / "rejected #N" commands in listener

## 🟢 DIFFERENTIATION — Stand out from other candidates

### Portfolio writeup (moorelab.cloud)
- [x] Case study drafted: `output/portfolio-case-study-career-ops.md` ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] Architecture diagram (ASCII, scan → evaluate → apply → followup → prep) ✅
- [x] Metrics table (10 evals, 4 applied, 4 platforms, 99 companies, 77 tests) ✅
- [x] Framing: "same pattern I apply at work — regulated-env AI automation with HITL" ✅
- [x] Cover letters already link moorelab.cloud ✅
- [ ] **PATRICK:** Review tone, publish to moorelab.cloud, add screenshots of auto-apply

### Competitive intelligence layer
- [ ] For each applied company, auto-pull: recent funding, headcount growth, Glassdoor trends
- [ ] Add to interview-prep docs
- [ ] Feed into cover letter generation (reference company's recent moves)
- [ ] Check for recent security incidents (shows awareness, potential conversation starter)
- [ ] Sources: Crunchbase API (free tier), Glassdoor scrape, Google News

### Score recalibration from outcomes
- [ ] After 20+ applications, analyze: which scores correlate with callbacks?
- [ ] Track: score → response rate → interview rate → offer rate
- [ ] Auto-adjust thresholds based on actual outcomes
- [ ] Monthly Telegram report: "Your 4.3+ roles get callbacks 60% of the time. Consider lowering auto-apply to 4.3."

## 🔧 SYSTEM FIXES — Known bugs and tech debt

### merge-tracker.mjs dedup bug
- [x] Fix: switched roleFuzzyMatch from min-ratio to Jaccard similarity (0.75 threshold) ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] Root cause: overlap/minLen gave false positives for shared generic words ✅
- [x] Test cases pass: Abridge AppSec vs InfraSec correctly treated as different ✅
- [x] test-all.mjs passes (72/72) ✅
- [ ] Add regression test to test-all.mjs (roleFuzzyMatch unit tests)

### scan.mjs Spanish headers
- [x] `## Pendientes` → `## Pending` in pipeline.md ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] scan.mjs updated to write English headers (backward compat with legacy Spanish) ✅
- [ ] Won't survive upstream update — re-apply after `update-system.mjs apply`

### Playwright version sync
- [ ] CT 203 and local now both on 1.60.0 ✅
- [ ] Add to `npm run doctor` check: warn if CT 203 version differs from local

### Built In Colorado scanner
- [x] `scan-builtin.mjs` — Playwright scraper for Built In Colorado search pages ✅ 2026-05-25
- [x] 7 search categories: Security, Cloud Security, AI, DevSecOps/SRE, Platform, InfraSec, Cybersec ✅
- [x] Reuses portals.yml title filters and scan-history.tsv dedup ✅
- [x] Added to daily-pipeline.sh (step 2/5) ✅
- [ ] Test on CT 203 (needs Playwright chromium on the container)
